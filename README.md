My pet project (´｡• ᵕ •｡)

Main goal of this app is to help to manage your incomings of freelance projects. Most often payments from projects splited for 2 or more parts. And sometimes customer pay last part too much weeks or month after you completed the project. And it happens like this:

customer: how much i own you?

you: *starting to recall all incomings, counting, opening bank app, recall the price you were agreed*

This simple app is gives you a possibility to add projects, with price of it, add incomings with dates, and count the remainder that custumer owe you.
